    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="javascript specification">javascript</a> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;">The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
