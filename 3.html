                    title="javascript specification">javascript</a> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled
                language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
                object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven,
                functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
                working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
                (DOM).</p>
            <img src="img/js.jpg" width="400px">
            <p style="margin-top:40px;">The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as
                networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system
                provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two
                languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
